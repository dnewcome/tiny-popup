{"name":"Tiny-popup","tagline":"Minimal robust Javascript pop-up dialog","body":"# About\r\n\r\nTinyPopup is designed to be the most minimal lightbox-style popup window while still\r\nproviding robust behavioral characteristics. These are, ability to handle scrolling\r\nwithout losing position, handling resizing of the browser window, and handling\r\nclick-to-close such that we almost can't create an un-dismissable dialog.\r\n\r\n# Goals\r\n\r\nSingle file with all needed styling and behavior. No external css or image \r\nfiles required. The total minified size is a bit over 1k, I'd like to keep\r\nit hovering just at the 1k mark.\r\n\r\nNo external dependencies. We don't need jQuery or anything like that for \r\nthis to work. My initial use case for this library is a userjs/Greasemonkey\r\nscript so I don't want to have to pull in any external things to make\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nRobust behavior - no funny stuff on different browsers with regards to \r\nscaling, scrolling, window resizing, getting stuck open, etc.\r\n\r\nMobile support - I'm aiming to fully support mobile devices, although\r\nI've only tested things out on iOS thus far.\r\n\r\nNothing but what is necessary to show a centered popup dialog. No \r\nextra styling beyond the css positioning code needed to make it show/hide\r\nproperly. However, it is styleable externally using css. This is the \r\npreferred method of working with TinyPopup.\r\n\r\n# Future Work\r\n\r\n* Provide callback registration for notification of popup dismissal. \r\nI didn't need this right away so I didn't implement it. However, it \r\nmay fall within scope here.\r\n\r\n* Register and coordinate multiple popups. I didn't need this right away\r\nbut I'm thinking about providing some support for several different named\r\npopups based on html template chunks. We'd want to use the same shadow\r\nelement I think and we'd want to ensure that only one popup can show\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
