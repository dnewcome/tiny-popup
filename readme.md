# About

TinyPopup is designed to be the most minimal lightbox-style popup window while still
providing robust behavioral characteristics. These are, ability to handle scrolling
without losing position, handling resizing of the browser window, and handling
click-to-close such that we almost can't create an un-dismissable dialog.
