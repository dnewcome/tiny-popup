<p>TinyPopup is designed to be the most minimal lightbox-style popup window while still
providing robust behavioral characteristics. These are, ability to handle scrolling
without losing position, handling resizing of the browser window, and handling
click-to-close such that we almost can't create an un-dismissable dialog.</p>

<h1>
<a name="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h1>

<p>Single file with all needed styling and behavior. No external css or image 
files required. The total minified size is a bit over 1k, I'd like to keep
it hovering just at the 1k mark.</p>

<p>No external dependencies. We don't need jQuery or anything like that for 
this to work. My initial use case for this library is a userjs/Greasemonkey
script so I don't want to have to pull in any external things to make
this work.</p>

<p>Robust behavior - no funny stuff on different browsers with regards to 
scaling, scrolling, window resizing, getting stuck open, etc.</p>

<p>Mobile support - I'm aiming to fully support mobile devices, although
I've only tested things out on iOS thus far.</p>

<p>Nothing but what is necessary to show a centered popup dialog. No 
extra styling beyond the css positioning code needed to make it show/hide
properly. However, it is styleable externally using css. This is the 
preferred method of working with TinyPopup.</p>

<h1>
<a name="future-work" class="anchor" href="#future-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Work</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide callback registration for notification of popup dismissal. 
I didn't need this right away so I didn't implement it. However, it 
may fall within scope here.</p></li>
<li><p>Register and coordinate multiple popups. I didn't need this right away
but I'm thinking about providing some support for several different named
popups based on html template chunks. We'd want to use the same shadow
element I think and we'd want to ensure that only one popup can show
at once.</p></li>
